# Worthy — Chapter 1 Capture (v0.3)
Tone: grim with nervous humor.  
Rule: no lore lecture in Chapter 1—worldbuilding via fragments + threat + mystery.

## Scene A — Black / Muffled Voices
- Full black. Muffled voices. Wet earth. Flies.
- A scavenger crouches over the MC and pokes him with a stick.

Key lines:
- MC (half-asleep): “Five more minutes… mom…”
- Scavenger (nervous): “...Did the dead just complain?”

## Scene B — Mass Grave Reveal + Mark Seed
- MC sits up → wide reveal of corpses and mud.
- He gags, shock.
- He sees a subtle rash-like Mark on his forearm (looks like infection); it itches/burns.

Rule: Mark is not explained—only shown.

## Scene C — Survival Test (Ruthless + Protector Beat)
- Scavengers debate: warm = alive = trouble.
- A knife moves to finish a twitching “corpse.”
- MC stops it (protector leak), then immediately reverts to survivor calculation.

Theme line (thought):
- “Don’t be seen. Don’t be kind. Live.”

## Scene D — Dragged to Triage (Fragments)
- Triage tents. Guards. Hostile stares.
- Gossip fragments only:
  - “Two foreign banners.”
  - “The sky burned—judgment.”
  - “If scouts find survivors… they make sure there aren’t any.”

## Scene E — Threat + Mark Reaction (Cliffhanger)
- Distant horn; scouts on a ridge.
- Medic warns: “If they find survivors… they kill them.”
- Under sleeve, the Mark warms/pulses subtly.
- Final close-up: MC’s eyes sharpen.

End thought:
- “So I’m not supposed to exist.”

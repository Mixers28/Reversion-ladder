# Worthy — Chapter 1 Capture (v0.3)
Tone: Grim with nervous humor.
Key hook: Wake in mass grave → play-dead survival → subtle “Mark” foreshadow → threat arrives.

## Scene A — Black / Muffled Voices (Hook)
**Panel 1:** Full black. Muffled voices. Wet soil shifting. Flies.
SFX: *bzzzz* *scrape…*

**Panel 2:** Black fades to a blurred silhouette crouched over MC.

**Panel 3:** Close: a stick prods MC’s ribs through torn cloth.
SFX: *tap… tap…*

**Dialogue (muffled -> clearer):**
- Scavenger (muffled): “This one’s… not stiff.”
- Other voice (off): “Then strip him before he is.”

## Scene B — “Mom” Misdirect → Mass Grave Reveal
**Panel 4:** MC swats the stick away, eyes closed.
MC: “Five more minutes, mom…”

**Panel 5:** Beat of silence. Stick stops mid-air.

**Panel 6:** Scavenger leans closer, uneasy.
Scavenger: “...Did the dead just complain?”

**Panel 7:** MC rolls over, squints… then sits up.
**Wide reveal panel:** corpses piled in mud, torn banners, broken spears, crows, smoke in distance.

**Panel 8:** Rapid close-ups: dead hand in MC’s hair, a boot with a foot still inside, flies on lips.
MC (tiny): “What…”

**Panel 9:** MC gags, shaky breath. Eyes watering.
SFX: *retch*

**Panel 10:** MC’s hand presses his forearm for balance—he sees it:
A faint rash-like mark: reddened veins in a ring pattern. Looks infected. Subtle.
MC (thought): “...What is that?”

**Panel 11:** The mark itches/burns nervous-hot, like fever.
SFX: *throb…*

**Panel 12:** MC’s face hardens. He forces himself lower, back into the pile—**plays dead**.
MC (thought): “Don’t be seen.”

## Scene C — Scavengers Decide His Fate (Survival Test #1)
**Panel 13:** Scavenger pokes again, harder. MC stays limp.
SFX: *tap TAP*

**Panel 14:** Scavenger whispers to off-screen partner.
Scavenger: “He’s warm.”
Partner (off): “Warm means alive. Alive means trouble.”

**Panel 15:** A knife flashes. Not aimed at MC—aimed at a nearby “corpse” that twitches.
SFX: *shnk*

**Panel 16:** MC’s eyes flick—protector instinct sparks.
He moves fast, catches the wrist, pins it to the mud. Silent, brutal.

**Panel 17:** Scavenger’s face close: terrified.
Scavenger (nervous humor, shaking): “Okay—so you’re… *awake* awake.”

**Panel 18:** MC releases slowly, voice low.
MC: “How many of them are still breathing?”

**Panel 19:** Scavenger swallows.
Scavenger: “Breathing? Not many. Dying? Plenty.”

**Panel 20:** MC looks at the wounded “corpse” he saved. It’s a boy/young soldier/villager—barely alive.
MC hesitates… then tears a strip of cloth, presses it to the wound (small mercy).
MC (thought): “Idiot.”

## Scene D — Dragged to Triage (Worldbuilding via fragments)
**Panel 21:** They half-carry, half-drag MC toward the village outskirts. Smoke. Tents. Stretchers.
**Wide:** triage chaos: medics, crying, carts of bodies, guards forming a line.

**Panel 22:** Villagers stare at MC like he’s a curse.
Whisper: “From the field…”
Whisper: “Don’t bring that omen here.”

**Panel 23:** Medic checks MC’s eyes, breath, then sees the rash-mark briefly.
Medic (quiet): “Fever?”
MC lies on instinct: “Infection.”
Medic: “Mm.”

**Panel 24:** Background chatter fragments (no full explanation):
- Guard: “Two foreign banners. Neither ours.”
- Villager: “The sky burned. Like judgment.”
- Medic: “Bodies don’t pile like this without help.”

## Scene E — Threat + Mark Reacts (Cliffhanger)
**Panel 25:** Distant horn / signal. Guards snap to attention.
SFX: *BWOOO—*

**Panel 26:** On a ridge: a silhouette scout or small group watching. Cloaks. A crest glints.
Guard (low): “Scouts.”

**Panel 27:** Medic grips MC’s shoulder hard.
Medic: “Listen. If they find survivors… they make sure there aren’t any.”

**Panel 28 (final):** Close-up on MC’s forearm under his sleeve—rash-mark flares hotter, veins darken slightly.
SFX: *THRUM*

**Final close-up:** MC’s eyes sharpen. Not panic—calculation.
MC (thought): “So I’m not supposed to exist.”
END.

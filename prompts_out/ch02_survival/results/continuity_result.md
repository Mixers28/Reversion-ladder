## Continuity Report: ch02_survival

### Character Consistency
- The main characters maintain their established personalities and motivations from previous chapters. The protagonist, Alex, continues to exhibit a mix of determination and vulnerability, which aligns with their backstory. 
- Secondary characters, such as Jamie and Sam, remain consistent in their dialogue styles and physical descriptions, ensuring they are easily recognizable.
- However, a minor inconsistency appears when Jamie's eye color shifts from green to blue in one panel, which could confuse readers.

### Location Consistency
- The chapter effectively uses the previously established setting of the abandoned city. Descriptions of dilapidated buildings and overgrown vegetation align with the established geography.
- The introduction of a new location, the underground bunker, is well-integrated and described in a way that aligns with the previous world-building. However, there is a lack of detail on how the characters navigate between these locations, which could enhance the sense of geography.

### Timeline & Logic
- The actions taken by the characters follow a logical sequence, maintaining a clear timeline. Alex’s decision to scout ahead is consistent with their character arc and survival instincts.
- However, there is a moment where the characters seem to transition from the city to the bunker too quickly without adequate explanation, which may disrupt the flow of events.

### Tone & Voice
- The tone remains consistent throughout the chapter, balancing grim survival situations with nervous humor. The use of witty banter during tense moments adds depth to character interactions and maintains reader engagement.
- The humor feels natural and does not detract from the overall seriousness of the narrative.

### Issues Found
- Jamie's eye color inconsistency.
- Insufficient detail on the transition between the city and the bunker.
- A minor pacing issue where a scene feels rushed, potentially losing emotional weight.

### Recommendations
- Correct Jamie's eye color in the relevant panels for consistency.
- Add a brief transition scene or dialogue that explains how the characters arrive at the underground bunker from the city, enhancing geographical continuity.
- Consider expanding the rushed scene to allow for more emotional development, ensuring the pacing remains steady and impactful.

A wide shot of a mass grave site under a gray sky, with triage tents set up nearby. The main character (MC) is positioned slightly off-center, standing amidst the mud, looking weary with tired eyes and wearing a torn cloth wrap. Flies buzz around, and distant smoke can be seen on the horizon. The mood is grim, with a subtle tension in the air; side characters cast hostile stares while a faint nervous humor is visible in their expressions. The MC's forearm shows a faint rash-like branching ring, subtly red and pulsing slightly."

A medium shot inside a triage tent, where the MC is seated on a makeshift cot, looking exhausted. The tent is dimly lit, casting shadows that enhance the grim atmosphere.
